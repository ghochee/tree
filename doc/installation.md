namespacing. All header includes have to be prefixed with `detangled/`.

Using [conan](https://conan.io) for setup. After setting up conan, the
following steps are required.

Setup the conan remote repository from which this header only library will be
pulled.

$ conan remote add ghochee https://api.bintray.com/conan/ghochee/conan
$
```

To add dependency to the package
```bash
project_dir$ cat conanfile.txt
[requires]
tree/0.1.0@ghochee/alpha
project_dir$
```

To install the package

project_dir$ mkdir .conan/
project_dir$ cd .conan 
project_dir$ conan install .. -r ghochee
project_dir$
```
