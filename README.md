@mainpage Overview

This library is a C++ container library for building trees.

It allows standard operations available and expected from trees. It also allows
for clients to derive more complicated data structures from the containers. It
also has a comprehensive iterator library around the container ala STL
containers. Classes are described in more detail at [Basic Trees](@ref basic).
